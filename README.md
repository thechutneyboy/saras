# saras (/Ëˆs.É¹ÊŒs/) (à¤¸à¤°à¤¸)

*saras* (Sanskrit for speech or anything fluid) wants to make pronunciation accessible and simple for those who are familiar with an Indic script like Devanagari (used for Hindi).

Learning another language is hard as it is and the fear of mispronouncing words makes new learners nervous.

*saras* not only bridges this gap, it can help someone speak almost any language (reasonably well) without learning the language; that too with no training! ðŸ˜„

Give it a try, [here](https://thechutneyboy.github.io/saras).

## Background

Pronunciation of words is codified using the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet) extensively and can be found in dictionaries, but it is difficult to read without training. It is primarily based on the Latin script but it is a script unto itself, making it inaccessible. 

[Indic scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahmic_scripts) however, are phonetic and have a rich coverage of sounds which make them very versatile and well suited for transliteration. They read like sheet music by design and are in daily use.
